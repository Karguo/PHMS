# Patient Health Monitoring System

## Patient Health Monitoring System 
is an app that has been developed using **Ruby on Rails (5.2.1)** with a **PostgreSQL** database. It also uses **jQuery Steps** for a multi-step wizard form for the end-user to use and **Chart js** to display the charts that will be generated from the entries.

### Approach
With the rise of technology-based health care, I wanted to develop an app to make it easier for the end-user (most of them who would be older) to enter their vital signs recordings on a daily basis. I wanted a clean and simple interface which is going to be simple to navigate around, especially for the older person. Ideally, this app would be used using a tablet. 

### Challenges
It was difficult trying to adapt and customise jQuery Steps and Chart js to the app's needs rather than the default settings. A lot of time was spent learning how those plugins work and then applying them to the app. 

### Next steps
I would like to develop the corresponding app for the healthcare professional who will be monitoring these readings. I would also like to develop a way in which the patient/end-user would be able to call/contact the healthcare professional with just a touch of a button ('Contact') on the app, ideally with a video stream. The healthcare professionals' interface would list all the current end-users and their individual readings for the week/month. 
Another idea could be that there is a emergency or alert button that can connect the end-user directly to emergency services. 

### Unresolved issues for the app
Not enough historical data to ensure that the charts will populated with the appropriate entries, so I have left in the charts that I have hard-coded the data in. 
More research is needed to make sure the colors and fonts for the app is appropriate for the intended audience. 
Had intended to change the way the readings are entered, perhaps using a scrollable number picker like https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/numberpicker or equivalent.
